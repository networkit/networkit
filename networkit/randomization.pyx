	The Edge Switching Markov Chain ["The markov chain simulation method for generating connected

	exchange their endpoints. Swaps that introduce multi-edges or self-loops are rejected WITHOUT
	replacement -- this is necessary to allow uniform sampling [see "Switching edges to randomize
	networks: what goes wrong and how to fix it", Carstens and Horadam]. The number of successful
	swaps can be queried using getNumberOfAffectedEdges()/2.

	We provide two implementations: EdgeSwitching takes a copy of the input graph and is more

	In general, simple edge switching does not yield a uniform distribution on simple DIRECTED

	DegreePreservingShuffle as a preprocessing step overcomes this limitation. The

	Implementation of the preprocessing step proposed in
	"Smaller Universes for Uniform Sampling of 0,1-matrices with fixed row and column sums"
	by Annabell Berger, Corrie Jacobien Carstens [https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02624]

	The algorithms randomizes a graph without changing its topology simply
	by renaming nodes. For any degree d (in case of an directed graph it's a degree pair)
	consider the set X_d of node ids which have this degree. Then shuffle the ids in X_d.

	Hence the algorithm satisfies: For all x in Ginput:
	 i)  Ginput.degreeIn(x) = Goutput.degreeIn(x)
	 ii) Ginput.degreeOut(x) = Goutput.degreeOut(x)

	The authors argue that applying this preprocessing step before executing (Global)Curveball
	leads to a faster mixing time. If you want to use it as a preprocessing step to GlobalCurveball,
	it's more efficient to set degreePreservingShufflePreprocessing in GlobalCurveball's constructor.
