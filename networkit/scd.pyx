	This class evaluates a set found communities against a ground truth cover. Each found community

	For each score, the ground truth community is chosen as comparison that maximizes the score.
	If seeds are not ignored (a parameter of the constructor), then only ground truth communities

	The calculated scores are:

	Precision: the size of the intersection of found and ground truth community divided by the
	size of the found community, i.e., how much of the found community was an actual match.

	Recall: the size of the intersection of found and ground truth community divided by the

	F1 score: the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
