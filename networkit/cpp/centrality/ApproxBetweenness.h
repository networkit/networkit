	 * the number of edges of the graph. The number of samples is proportional to universalConstant/epsilon^2.
	 * Although this algorithm has a theoretical guarantee, the algorithm implemented in Estimate Betweenness usually performs better in practice
	 * Therefore, we recommend to use EstimateBetweenness if no theoretical guarantee is needed.
