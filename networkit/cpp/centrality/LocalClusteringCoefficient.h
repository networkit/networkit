	 * There are two algorithms available. The trivial (parallel) algorithm needs only a small amount of additional memory.
	 * The turbo mode adds a (sequential, but fast) pre-processing step using ideas from [0]. This reduces the running time
	 * significantly for most graphs. However, the turbo mode needs O(m) additional memory. In practice this should be a bit
	 * less than half of the memory that is needed for the graph itself. The turbo mode is particularly effective for graphs
	 * with nodes of very high degree and a very skewed degree distribution.
