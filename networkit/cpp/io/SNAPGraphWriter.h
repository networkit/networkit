/**
 * @ingroup io
 * Write graph in the Georgia Tech SNAP (Small-world Network
 * Analysis and Partitioning) (http://snap-graph.sourceforge.net/)
 * file format (do not confuse this with the Stanford Network Analysis Project.)
 * From the SNAP user guide:
 *
 * A sample graph file in the SNAP format (.gr extension)
 * (lines beginning with a # symbol indicate comments)
 *
 * p denotes the problem line
 * p <n> <m> <undirected/directed> <weight_type> <0 or 1-indexed>
 *
 * n indicates the number of vertices.
 *
 * m denotes the number of edges.
 *
 * The third parameter can be either u denoting a undirected graph,
 * or d denoting a directed graph. Internally, an edge <u, v> in an
 * undirected graph is stored as two directed links u->v and v->u.
 *
 * weight_type can be u (unweighted), i (integer), l (long, 8 bytes on 64-bit
 * architectures), f (float), or d (double)
 *
 * For the fifth parameter, 0 indicates that the valid range of vertex IDs
 * is 0 to n-1. 1 indicates that it is 1 to n.
 *
 * The problem line is followed by a listing on exactly m edges. The format
 * is <u v w> for a weighted graph, and <u v> for an unweighted graph.
 *
 * Good job
