 * Algorithm for listing all maximal cliques.

 * Listing All Maximal Cliques in Large Sparse Real-World Graphs.

 *
 * The running time of this algorithm should be in @f$O(d^2 \cdot n \cdot 3^{d/3})@f$
 * where @f$d@f$ is the degeneracy of the graph, i.e., the maximum core number.
 * The running time in practice depends on the structure of the graph. In
 * particular for complex networks it is usually quite fast, even graphs with
 * millions of edges can usually be processed in less than a minute.
