/**
 * A quality measure that measures the dominance of hubs in clusters. The hub dominance of a single
 * cluster is defined as the maximum cluster-internal degree of a node in that cluster divided by
 * the maximum cluster-internal degree, i.e. the number of nodes in the cluster minus one. The
 * value for all clusters is defined as the average of all clusters.
 * This implementation is a natural generalization of this measure for covers.
 * Strictly speaking this is not a quality measure as this is rather dependent on the type of the
 * considered graph, for more information see
 * Lancichinetti A, Kivel M, Saramki J, Fortunato S (2010)
 * Characterizing the Community Structure of Complex Networks
