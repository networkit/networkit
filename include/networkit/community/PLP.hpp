 * As described in Ovelgoenne et al: An Ensemble Learning Strategy for Graph Clustering
 * Raghavan et al. proposed a label propagation algorithm for graph clustering.
 * This algorithm initializes every vertex of a graph with a unique label. Then, in iterative
 * sweeps over the set of vertices the vertex labels are updated. A vertex gets the label
 * that the maximum number of its neighbors have. The procedure is stopped when every vertex
 * has the label that at least half of its neighbors have.
