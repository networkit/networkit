/**
 * @ingroup community
 * Compare a given cover to a reference cover using the F1 measure.
 * This is a typical similarity measure used to compare the found
 * overlapping community structure to a ground truth community
 * structure. Each cluster is compared to the best-matching reference
 * cluster (in terms of highest F1 score). A value of 1 indicates
 * perfect agreement while a while of 0 indicates complete
 * disagreement. An example where this measure is used is the
 * following paper:
 *
 * Alessandro Epasto, Silvio Lattanzi, and Renato Paes
 * Leme. 2017. Ego-Splitting Framework: from Non-Overlapping to
 * Overlapping Clusters. In Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD
 * International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining
 * (KDD '17). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 145-154. DOI:
