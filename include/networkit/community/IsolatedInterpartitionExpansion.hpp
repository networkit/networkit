/**
 * Isolated inter-partition expansion is a measure for how well a partition
 * (communtiy/cluster) is separated from the rest of the graph.
 *
 * The expansion of a partition is defined as the weight of the cut divided
 * by number of nodes in the partition or in the rest of the graph, whatever
 * is smaller. Small values thus indicate that the cut is small compared to
 * the size of the smaller of the separated parts. For the whole partitions
 * usually the maximum or the unweighted average is used. Note that expansion
 * values can be larger than 1.
 *
 * See also Experiments on Density-Constrained Graph Clustering,
