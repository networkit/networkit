     * \details
     * This method implements the classic Successive Shortest Path (SSP) algorithm:
     *  - Initializes node potentials using Bellmanâ€“Ford to reweight edges
     *    (ensuring non-negative reduced costs).
     *  - Iteratively selects a supply node with positive imbalance.
     *  - Runs Dijkstra on the residual network (with reduced costs) to find
     *    the cheapest augmenting path to a reachable demand node.
     *  - Augments as much flow as possible along that path (bounded by supply,
     *    demand, and residual capacities).
     *  - Updates node potentials and node imbalances.
     *
     * The process continues until all supplies are pushed to demands.
     * At the end, the edge attribute \c FLOW contains the computed flow on
     * each edge, and \c getTotalCost() can be used to retrieve the total cost.
     *
     * \throws std::runtime_error if:
     *  - a negative-cost cycle is detected in the residual graph,
     *  - or if there exists remaining supply/demand that cannot be routed to any demand/supply.
