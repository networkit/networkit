/**
 * @ingroup graph
 * This algorithm computes the betweenness centrality for a specified focus node x.
 * It works for dynamic graphs that can be undirected/directed and unweighted/weighted without
 * negative cycles. The Algorithm proceeds as described in [1]. The run() method computes the
 * betweenness centrality by computing SSSP (similar to Dijkstra) for each node.
 * The update() method only works with edge insertions and edge weight decrements and has a WC
 * runtime complexity of O(nÂ²) which outperforms the DynamicBetweenness algorithm for all nodes
 * (instead of one focus node) that takes O(nm).
