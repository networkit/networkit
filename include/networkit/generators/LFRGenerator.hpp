/**
 * @ingroup generators
 * The LFR clustered graph generator as introduced by Andrea Lancichinetti, Santo Fortunato, and
 * Filippo Radicchi.
 *
 * The community assignment follows the algorithm described in
 * "Benchmark graphs for testing community detection algorithms". The edge generation is however
 * taken from their follow-up publication "Benchmarks for testing community detection algorithms on
 * directed and weighted graphs with overlapping communities". Parts of the implementation follow
 * the choices made in their implementation which is available at
 * https://sites.google.com/site/andrealancichinetti/software but other parts differ, for example
 * some more checks for the realizability of the community and degree size distributions are done
 * instead of heavily modifying the distributions.
 *
 * The edge-switching markov-chain algorithm implementation in NetworKit is used which is different
 * from the implementation in the original LFR benchmark.
