     * Creates random graphs in the G(n,p) model.

     * and Ulrik Brandes: "Efficient generation of large random networks",
     * Phys Rev E 71, 036113 (2005) with a runtime of O((n+m) / P) (WHP),
     * where n, m, and P are the numbers of nodes, edges and parallel threads
     * respectively.
     *
     * The generator can also be used to generate empty or complete graphs
     * efficiently by setting (p = 0.0 or p = 1.0). Observe that this is
     * implemented as a special case and requires p to be exactly zero or
     * one.
     *
     * @warning For compatibility reasons, the generator does not produce
     * self-loops by default.
     *
     * @param nNodes Number of nodes n in the graph.
     * @param prob Probability of existence for each edge p.
     * @param directed  generates a directed graph
     * @param self_loops Controls whether a directed graph may contain self_loops
     *                   (undirected graphs never have them)
