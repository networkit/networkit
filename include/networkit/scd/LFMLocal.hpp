 * Their algorithm detects overlapping communities by repeatedly
 * executing this algorithm for a random seed node that has not yet
 * been assigned to any community.
 *
 * The algorithm has a resolution parameter alpha. A natural choice
 * for alpha is 1, the paper states that values below 0.5 usually
 * give a community containing the whole graph while values larger
 * than 2 recover the smallest communities.
