PageRank is a version of eigenvector centrality which introduces a damping factor, modeling a random web surfer which at some point stops following links and jumps to a random page. In PageRank theory, centrality is understood as the probability of such a web surfer to arrive on a certain page. Our implementation of both measures is based on parallel power iteration, a relatively simple eigensolver."

The local clustering coefficient focuses on a single node and counts how many of the possible edges between neighbors of the node exist.
