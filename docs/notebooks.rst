Jupyter Notebook
================

NetworKit is designed to provide a high level of interactivity to give the user the possibility to create own workflows and a network analysis tool which is easy to use.
This is accomplished by providing a Python interface to use NetworKit in an interactive Python shell. Complete workflows can be created with Jupyter Notebook - a web-based interactive computing environment.
